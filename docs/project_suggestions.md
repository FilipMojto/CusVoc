## ERD diagram and database design v0.0.1

    This ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) represents a well-structured design with a clear understanding of the relationships between different entities involved in your application. Here are some observations and recommendations:

    Normalization and Structure:

    The ERD is well-normalized, meaning that data redundancy is minimized. The use of separate tables for Lexeme, Definition, PartOfSpeech, and Collocate ensures that repeated data is stored efficiently.
    The LDPC_Instance table acts as a junction table, connecting Lexeme, Definition, PartOfSpeech, and Collocate, which is a good approach to manage many-to-many relationships.
    Field Choices:

    The use of integer IDs as primary keys in all tables is a good practice, allowing for efficient indexing and joins.
    The fields test_count, was_tested, and for_practice in the LDPC_Instance table are clearly defined and seem appropriate for tracking testing and practice sessions.
    The total_match_ratio field with a constraint ensuring it does not exceed test_count is a well-thought-out mechanism for maintaining data integrity.
    Usability and Clarity:

    The diagram includes helpful annotations explaining constraints and the purpose of certain fields (e.g., test_count must be positive, total_match_ratio <= test_count). These annotations improve the clarity of the ERD.
    The abbreviation LDPC (Lexeme-Definition-PartOfSpeech-Collocate) is informative, but it might be difficult to interpret quickly for someone unfamiliar with the system. This could be refined or expanded upon.
    Potential Improvements:

    Indexes: While indexes are not explicitly shown in the ERD, ensure that indexes are created on foreign key fields (e.g., lexeme_id, definition_id, etc.) for better query performance.
    Data Integrity: Consider adding more explicit constraints if needed. For instance, ensuring that total_match_ratio is always within a logical range could be enforced by the database.
    Versioning: If definitions or collocates change over time, you may want to include versioning information (e.g., timestamps or version numbers) to track changes.
    Alternative Terms for LDPC_Instance
    Since LDPC_Instance is a central table connecting multiple entities, a more descriptive or intuitive name could enhance the understanding of its purpose. Here are some suggestions:

    LexemeUsage
    LexicalEntry
    LanguageContext
    LexemeContext
    LexicalInstance
    WordUsage
    ExpressionRecord
    LexicalMapping
    LanguageUnit
    PhraseEntry
    Each of these alternatives aims to convey the idea that this table represents a specific instance or usage of a lexeme within a certain context, including its definition, part of speech, and collocate.
